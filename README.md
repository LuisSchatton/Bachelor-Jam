# Jam - an interactive concept for learning the drums

Learning a new instrument can improve a persons life in a wide array of ways. It helps with coordination and creative thinking. This project wants to explore how, with the help of modern technological possibilities, normally boring parts of learning the drums can be made fun through gamification.

To explore this, this project uses the open-source engine Godot, testing different ways with a wide array of prototypes. The scripts are written using **GDScript**, a scripting language native to Godot, which is essentially a python layer on top of C++. The intuitive form of this language made it perfect for someone switching over from JavaScript.

The design of the project is inspired by rhythm games and uses different visual and sound effects as well as scoring techniques borrowed from this sector to transform the way the students interacts with the lessons.

Lessons can be created and shared by teachers, which is facilitated by the architecture of the game. All charts are generated using MIDI data, which means teachers can use software they already own to create lessons for their students.
